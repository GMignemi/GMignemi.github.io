I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics [BIDSA](https://bidsa.unibocconi.eu/people/faculty) under the joint supervision of [Antonio Lijoi](https://didattica.unibocconi.it/mypage/index.php?IdUte=189615&amp%3Bcognome=LIJOI&amp%3Bnome=ANTONIO&amp%3BurlBackMy=) and [Igor Pruenster](https://mypage.unibocconi.eu/igorpruenster/).  

I earned my PhD in Psychometrics in 2024 from the Department of General Psychology at the University of Padova under the supervision of [Andrea Spoto](https://dpg.unipd.it/category/ruoli/personale-docente?key=6DB5058FD70BCB294F3B6A43724D4A02) and [Antonio Calcagni](https://lilia.dpss.psy.unipd.it/~antonio.calcagni/). I spent the last year of my PhD visiting the Statistics Departments of UCL and LSE collaborating with [Ioanna Manolopoulou](https://ioannamanolopoulou.github.io/), [Yunxiao Chen](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics/people/yunxiao-chen) and [Irini Moustaki](https://irmoustaki.github.io/).
